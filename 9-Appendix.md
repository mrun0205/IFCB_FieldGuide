# Appendix B:

### **Beads solution recipe:**

- [ ] 500 uL Micro-90
- [ ] 120 ml MQ (or ultrapure) water
- [ ] 80 ul 6 um fluorescent beads in Sodium Azide

- [ ] 10 ml 4% Sodium Azide solution

120 ml of this solution is required to completely refill the beads syringe inside the IFCB. This solution can be prepared and stored in the dark at 4â„ƒ for several months. This bead solution can also be used to align PMT signals

### **Azide solution recipe:**

4% weight per volume of Sodium Azide solution can be prepared and stored for several months. 400 ml of this solution is enough to fill a reagent bag comfortably. This amount of reagents should last for ~9000 samples. Note: This is a hazardous solution and safety standards should be observed in the preparation, storage and disposal of the solution.

### **Detergent solution recipe:**

1% Terg-a-zyme and 5% Contrad 70 weight by volume solution can be prepared and stored for several months. 400 ml of this solution is enough to fill a reagent bag and should last for ~9000 sample runs.
