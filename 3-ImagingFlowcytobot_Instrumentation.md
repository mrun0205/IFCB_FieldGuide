# 3. Imaging FlowCytobot - introduction to instrumentation

When delivered the IFCB will have been aligned and tested by McLane Laboratories, and will come with a manual with detailed instructions about the first start up and how to prepare it for sampling for the first time (https://mclanelabs.com/imaging-flowcytobot/ifcb-manuals-0/).

The IFCB is a complex instrument, and is sensitive to mechanical shocks and vibrations, which should be taken into consideration when planning a deployment or for transport to deployment site. The optics are situated on the outer edge of the harness, and are particularly sensitive when the IFCB is being lowered into its pressure housing prior to canning. The syringe and fluidics are situated above the power harness, housekeeping board, and CPU which are very sensitive to moisture, so it is imperative to check the fluidics for leaks and run regular cleaning runs on the IFCB (see IFCB canning and set up for details). If using the IFCB in mostly marine systems, salt crystals can form over time inside the fluidic connections if the IFCB is left unused, and it is advised to not let the IFCB sit dry without running samples for more than 2 consecutive days, the McLane labs manual has details for long-term inactive storage of IFCBs and steps that can be taken to avoid damage to the fluidics and flow cell.

## 3.1. Considerations for deployment

The following specific configuration approaches are used by our group for different types of deployments. The primary considerations to be kept in mind while preparing for deployment are: 

\-    A continuous source of water for the IFCB to sample

\-    Vibration and mechanical shocks to the pressure housing of the IFCB

\-    Access to a continuous power supply

\-    Ability to toggle power supply

\-    Access to an internet connection/ cell phone connectivity

Specific configuration approaches are used by our group to suit individual deployments, and additional instrumentation associated with the IFCB can be used to make the IFCB suitable for the site.

- ####  IFCB communication cable:

We use the type D/P-P4TP24#/4C18# cable of suitable length. A short cable of 3-ft length can be used in conjunction with an extension cord of the same type to avoid twisting of the cable at the power source. These cables can be acquired from the following retailers:

- ####  Instrument buoyancy

The IFCB is buoyant when submerged in water and needs added weight to weigh it down and ensure it stays vertical in the water column. We use an iron doughnut which can be screwed to the bottom of the IFCB pressure housing for this purpose. The IFCB can then be lowered into the water column and secured at a suitable height to ensure continuous supply of water to the intake tubing.

- ####  Anodization

The pressurized housing of the IFCB is made of aluminum and is susceptible to corrosion. To prevent this corrosion when the IFCB is submerged in water, a sacrificial anode must be attached to the IFCB to provide anodization (see IFCB canning and set up for details).

- ####  Bio-fouling

The intake tubing of the IFCB is fitted with a 150 Âµm mesh as described in the McLane manual. However, for longer term deployment and in deployments where the IFCB is submerged in the water column where biofouling is a concern an additional copper mesh can be attached to the intake and outlet to prevent biofouling from interrupting water supply to the IFCB.

- ####  Connectivity for data transfer

If a wired internet connection is not available on-site a modem/router such as an MP70 can be used for connecting to the IFCB and data transfers. If cell phone connectivity is not possible, e.g. on board research vessels a router can be used to create a wired or unwired connection between the IFCB and a computer so that data can be backed up on a computer external to the IFCB for Image Identification.
