    1. Overview
    1.1. Need for monitoring
    1.2. What is an Imaging FlowCytobot? What are capabilities?
    1.3. Where are we deploying it?
    1.4. Sensor requirements
    2. Basic field deployment requirements
    2.1. Power system
    2.2. Instrumentation
    2.3. Cellular modem
    3. Imaging FlowCytobot - introduction to instrumentation
    3.1. Considerations for deployment
    IFCB communication cable:
    Instrument buoyancy
    Anodization
    Bio-fouling
    Connectivity for data transfer
    4. IFCB – setting up for installation
    4.1. Pre-canning check
    4.2. Cellular modem set up
    4.2.1. New MP70 set up
    4.2.2. Setting up the MP70 with a pre-configured template file
    4.3. Backup power setup (APC Smart-UPS 1500VA LCD with network card 2)
    4.4. Router set up (For offshore cruise deployment or when connection to internet is not possible)
    4.5. Digital logger switch setup for remote power toggling
    4.6. Canning the IFCB
    5. IFCB Field setup types
    5.1. Dockside submerged deployment
    5.2. Dockside surface deployment
    5.3. Shipboard deployment
    6. IFCB – basic operation for sampling
    6.1. Starting up the IFCB
    6.1.1. Basic operations using the Windows OS
    6.1.2. Basic Operations using the Linux OS
    6.1.3. Basic Operations using Dockerized IFCBacquire with "headless" CPU (NVIDIA, Versalogic, ADLink with WHOI IFCBacquire + PhytO-ARM image)
    6.2. Stopping the IFCB after sampling
    7. IFCB routine assessment, daily check-ins
    7.1. Daily Check in
    7.2. Long-term check-ins
    8. IFCB common issues, known problems and how to manage
    Issue: Sudden spike in image files on dashboard, duplicate images, same spot being captured as ROI:
    Issue: IFCB sampled air, position of ROI’s is random (all over flow cell)
    Issue: Acquisition restarts with no/few ROI’s or after incomplete
    Issue: Stains on flow cell
    Issue: Bad flow, ROI’s appear spread out over large area, when running beads some beads appear in focus and others do not.
    Issue: Grinding noise, rough noise from pumps coupled with bad flow
